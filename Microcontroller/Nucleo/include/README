These files are libraries to interface the STM32 Nucleo F746ZG ARM microcontroller with various sensors, chips, and breakout boards. 

Credits for the 'Ping.h' library are given to Tim Eckel and his 'New Ping' library for Arduino. Most of the logic is based on his work.

    Ping.h
        -Interfaces Mbed OS based system with generic ultrasonic sensors. 
        -Only a single pin is needed - the library will toggle it between output and input.
        -Can form array of sensors. Example:
            Ping sonar[NUM_DEVICES]= {
                Ping(PinName, MAX_DISTANCE),
                Ping(PinName, MAX_DISTANCE)
            };
        
        Methods:
        -Ping(PinName, unsigned int max_cm_distance)
        -unsigned int ping(unsigned int max_cm_distance)     Returns round-trip time in uS
        -unsigned int ping_cm(unsigned int max_cm_distance)  Retruns distnace in cm

        TODO:
        -Create interrupts for sensor input, no need to wait around for responses
        -Ensure efficiency

    WiFly.h
        -Static library of function
        -Defines DigitalOut, InterruptIn, Timer, and Timeour interfaces necessary for WiFly
        -Handles interrupts
        
        Methods:
        -void wifiConfig()
        -void wifiDisconnectHost()
        -int wifiInit()
        -void wifiConnectPing()

        ISRs:
        -void wifi_ISR(void)
        -void connectionTimeOut(void)
        -void hostLost(void)
        -void hostGained(void)
        -void networkLost(void)
        -void networkGained(void)

        TODO:
        -Enable string processing instead of handling each char individually
        -Test system thouroughly to ensure reliability
        -Retrict from disconnecting with host after period of time --May be server side issue
